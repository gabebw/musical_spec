* Formatter correctly will not go higher than the highest note now, instead of
  doing that odd 3-note trill that it did before. The vagaries of scientific pitch
  notation!
* Music starts at the lowest possible pitch and climbs to the highest, so now
  you get the full scale instead of getting to the highest note too early.
